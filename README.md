<b>The Institute to Advance Diversity is a web application to promote career advancement for underrepresented minorities through mentorship. IAD is an MVP and due to the properity nature of the code, I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL,.NET, and React code. </b>

My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of an events creation feauture. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. I also integrated Twillio's SendGrid API to our .Net application.  Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

● Designed and implemented an event feature that allows users to create their event, venue, and location details through one form using react-loki to design a user-friendly interface. 
● Built form using the Formik Library inside responsive React components.
● Implemented client side validation using YUP Schemas.
● Designed and constructed a RESTful API in .NET Core that allowed for data access and manipulation from the front-end.
● <ul> Utilized Twilio Sendgrid’s API to handle sending emails throughout the application.</ul> 
● <ul> Implemented multiple features by creating and updating SQL tables and stored procedures, connecting Data Layers Services with REST APIs to connect React components via AJAX request.</ul> 
● <ul> Learned to operate under a highly-functional system of source control and work-flow management through Github, Git and Trello.</ul> 
● <ul> Contributed to a high-energy, fast-paced development team utilizing AGILE methodologies by participating in code reviews, daily stand ups and weekly code talks.</ul>
